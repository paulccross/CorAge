The severity of COVID19 tends to increase with age. Here, rather than enter the severity for each age-class the user enters the proportion of cases that are severe for youngsters and the elderly. The model then interpolates and exponential curve between these two depending on the number of age categories (see Parameter plot). A proportion of those severe cases are then assumed to die at different rates depending on whether they receive hospital care or not. The number of bed is the # of people that can be cared for in the hospital, reducing their death rate accordingly. Currently, the model assumes that these beds are provided proportional to the case load (first come, first served).
