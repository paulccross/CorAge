The top plot is a heatmap of the contact matrix indicating how different age groups contact one another. Red values are higher contact rates than background. More blue colors are lower contact rates than the background. The bottom plot is the proportion of each age class that was exposed at the end of the simulation. If all contact rates are equal, then this should be a flat line. See the "Contacts" parameter tab.
