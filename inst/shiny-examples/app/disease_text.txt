Setting the transmission coefficient such that the ending proportion recovered is around 0.5 equates to an R_0 of around 2. Current COVID-19 estimates range from around 1.5 to 3.5 (or from 33 to 70% exposure rates). The next 4 parameters (exposure and infection progression and # of exposed and infectious subcategories) determine the length of the incubation and infectious periods (see the parameter plots page). The incubation period is currently thought to be around 3-10 days with a mean around 5. The infectious period is not well estimated but the timing of symptom onset to death can be around 2 weeks. The shiny model forces to be frequency dependent so that R_0 and transmission don't change when the user modifies the population size. This is more flexible in the R package.
