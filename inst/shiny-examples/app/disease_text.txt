Setting the transmission coefficient such that the ending proportion recovered is around 0.5 equates to an R0 of around 2. Current COVID-19 estimates range from around 1.5 to 3.5 (or from 33 to 70% exposure rates). The next 4 parameters (exposure and infection progression and # of exposed and infectious subcategories) determine the length of the incubation and infectious periods (see the parameter plots page). The incubation period is currently thought to be around 3-10 days with a mean around 5. The infectious period is not well estimated but the timing of symptom onset to death can be around 2 weeks. Theta controls whether the disease is frequency or density dependent. When population size is constant theta is unimportant. However, when the user changes the population size, they will also need to change beta to maintain the same prevalence unless theta is set to 1.
